Looking through this React component code, I can identify several issues and areas of duplication that should be fixed:
Issues Found:

Missing ExamQuestionManager import but not used - The component is imported but never used, while ExamBuilder is used but not imported.
Duplicate style definitions - There are inline styles repeated multiple times throughout the component that could be consolidated.
Memory leak potential - No cleanup for state updates after async operations.
Missing error boundaries - No error handling for failed API calls in some places.
